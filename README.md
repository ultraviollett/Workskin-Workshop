there are two options you can toggle between when inputting your work text: 'Rich Text' and 'HTML'

paste and edit your HTML into 'HTML'. Do everything else in 'Rich Text'. Click 'Preview' when you're done and check if there are any issues. AO3 very often likes to add extra line breaks, so check for those.
