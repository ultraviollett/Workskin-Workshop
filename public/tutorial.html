  <strong>Ao3 Workskin — </strong><br>
   Ao3 allows you to add CSS to your work with 'workskins'. 
   Like the example above, you need the workskin to add more than just basics.
   One of the more popular things to do with workskins is to use it to mimic 
   different things - like emails, messages, and social media sites.
   it can add a lot of immersion and make your fic look a lot cooler,
   especially if its a chat fic or socmed fic.
  </p>
  <p>
  Let's take a look at an example with the 'simple messaging' workskin:
  </p>
  
  <div class="codedemo">
    <div class="header"><p>Without Workskin</p></div>
    <div  class="text" >
      <p> Bing! You got a text! </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header"><p>With Workskin</p></div>
    <div  class="text" >
      <p> <div class="simplemsgexample">Bing! You got a text!</div></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br>
<p>
  <strong>HTML — </strong><br>
  aka "HyperText Markup Language", code used to create webpages. 
  You put text inside tags that makes it behave a certain way, 
  like adding a paragraph, making the text bold, or creating a list.
</p>

<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>HTML</p></div>
  <div  class="HTMLcoding" >
    <p> &lt;p&gt; I can be <span class="highlight">&lt;b&gt;</span>bold<span class="highlight">&lt;/b&gt;</span>,
  or even <span class="highlight">&lt;i&gt;</span>italics!<span class="highlight">&lt;/i&gt;</span> &lt;/p&gt; </p>
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>TEXT</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>I can be <b>bold</b>, or even <i>italics!</i></p> </div>

</div>
<br>
<p>
  <strong>CSS — </strong><br>
   aka "Cascading Style Sheets", code that adds style and structure to a webpage.
   It's usually put in a separate file, and then you use HTML tags to add it to the text.

</p>
<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>CSS</p></div>
  <div  class="CSScoding" >
    <p> <span class="highlight">.pinkbox</span>{ background-color: pink;<Br>
      padding: 5px;}
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>HTML</p></div>
  <div  class="HTMLcoding" >
    <p> &lt;p&gt; Wow, there's a &lt;span <span class="highlight">class = "pinkbox"</span>&gt;pink box! &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="codedemo appendcodedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>WITHOUT CSS</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>Wow, there's a pink box! </p></div>
  <div class="header"><p>TEXT WITH CSS</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>Wow, there's a <span class="pinkbox">pink box!</span> </p></div>

</div>
<br>

For a more indepth but still beginner-friendly explanation, I've linked a few things below.
But for the purposes of this website, as long as you know where to copy-paste everything,
you'll be able to use these generators.

<h2>How do I use the Workskin Workshop?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the generator you want to use</li>
<p>I've added examples so you can see what everything looks like.
  Make sure to read the Notes so you know how it works
</p>

<li>Generate the HTML and add it to your fic</li>
<p>
  Click the 'Generate HTML' button, then click 'Copy'. Go to edit your fic,
  place the HTML where you want it. Remember, it won't look like it does in the generator 
  until you add the workskin
</p>
<li>Generate the CSS and create a workskin</li>
<p>Go to the CSS generator and generate what you will use, then add it to a workskin. There is a more indepth tutorial on 
  creating workskins <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370">here</a>.
  After that, go to your fic and add the workskin to it.
<li>Check everything works</li>
<p>
  Check that what you added looks good on both desktop and mobile.
All good? If not, check if you copy-pasted the HTML or CSS wrong. If it still doesn't work,
or if you notice something off, send me a <a href="contactform.html">message</a>.

 <h2>How do I create my own workskin?</h2>
I'm so glad you're interested! Although I try and add a lot of options
when making the generators, it will never be as customizable as manipulating it yourself,
or creating your own!
<br><br>
Firstly, you need to know the basics of 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS</a>. Next,
 you need somewhere to edit your code. I wouldn't write it directly on Ao3, you WRITE.
 I, personally, use 
 <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics">VSCode</a> to write and edit the HTML/CSS. I understand that it can be
 intimidating to download a whole ass program for making workskins, but with VSCode,
 you can download
 <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server"> Microsoft Live Preview</a>
  to see how each change you make affects your code in real time!
  I've also added a link that will take you to an HTML specific guide 
  for using VSCode. It's for making your own website, but the setup is the 
  exact same.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am planning on making a workskin walkthrough at some point, so
 look out for that! But at the moment, if you have any problems (even 
 if you can't get VSCode to work for whatever reason), please message me with your 
 discord and I'll help with what I can.
 <br><Br>
For now, some general advice:
<Br>
<li>The CSS Ao3 allows you to use is limited. I've been told this might change in the future,
  but for now a lot of more modern HTML won't work
</li>
<li>
You can use only the default of flex</li>
<li>Ao3 has some defaults for paragraphs and divs that will make your 
  HTML look different than it does on VSCode / normally. Right click on whatever looks wonky, then click inspect and then
  look at the CSS section, it will tell you what's affecting what element.
<li>Ao3 automatically adds paragraphs after divs, and a few other situations, 
  so if your code looks wonky it might also be that.

 <h2>How would I make my own workskin generator?</h2>

 If you're considering it, PLEASE let me know and I'll help you through any
 issues, as well as linking your site to this site when its finished. I'm now
 assuming you have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and GitHub, but if not, I've linked
 a JavaScript and GitHub guide below.
 <br><br>
 I am using NeoCities to host this site, and the languages I'm using are 
 HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm using VSCode to build and test the site. I'm also using GitHub to automatically 
 update NeoCities, and have linked the guide for that below (as well as the actual 
 Workskin Workshop Repository, of course).
 <br><br>
 I've tried to add a lot of comments so it's easy to follow, so you
  can clone the repository and create your own 
 generators with most of the code already there.

You can also create a pull request for the repository and I'll look over it.
Don't forget to credit yourself!
