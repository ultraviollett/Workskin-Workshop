workskin tips (to be compiled later, probably in an ao3 work):
-use vscode, download microsoft
-can use flex defaults
-DONT USE FLOAT
-cant use grid, can use tables
-ao3 has default margins and line breaks
-use vw and max-width to achieve a nice looking workskin on all devices
-IF U HAVE A WHITE BACKGROUND PLEASE SET FONT COLOUR / AND OPPOSITE
-ao3 WILL add paragraphs to things you dont want it to
-USE SQUIDGE TO HOST IMAGES
